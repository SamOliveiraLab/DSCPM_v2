## Overview

DSCPM v2 provides a graphical interface for researchers to control syringe pump hardware without writing code. Key capabilities include:

- **Multi-pump support** — connect and control up to 10 pumps simultaneously
- **Four flow modes** — Constant, Pulse, Oscillation, and Pulse of Oscillation
- **Experiment builder** — visually create timed command sequences and export them as files
- **Pause / Resume / Restart** — full control over running experiments
- **Live file preview** — see exactly what commands will execute before running
